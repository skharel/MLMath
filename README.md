# How I am prepping for Math to survive Graduate School

## [Linear Algebra](./LinearAlgebra)

- But [why/how](https://youtu.be/LlKAna21fLE) is linear algebra important?

## [MATRIX METHODS IN DATA ANALYSIS, SIGNAL PROCESSING, AND MACHINE LEARNING](./MatrixMethods/)

- Pre-req: Know Linear Algebra

## [Calculus](./Calculus)

## [Statistics](./Statistics)

- Visual introduction to Stat: This is very nice website built to visualize and learn. This might be a very good accompanying resources while going through the stat course.

1. [Stat - 1:](./Statistics/stat-1) <br>
   This is based on STAT-110 [course offered by Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home). <br> <br>
   MIT has [similar course](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/)

2. [Stat - 2:](./Statistics/stat-2) <br>
   Based on [Statistics for Applications](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/index.htm) offered at MIT
